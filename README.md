# FSJS_Project_4


On this project we should build an ‘Guess the Phrase’ using OOJS - Object-Oriented Javascript.

We should create the code in 3 different files: game.js, app.js and phrase.js.

The player must try to guess the  phrase and can only miss 5 times before the game ends.

For extra credit I add a keyboard functionality and I alter some colors on the css file to match the Friends theme. I use the colors of the dots on the keys.
